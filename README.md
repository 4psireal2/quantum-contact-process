TODO:
- [x] Simulate QCP-1D in QuTiP using WFMC, ODE solver
- [] Check out Adam's and BDF method -> What exactly is going on in `mesolve`?
- [] Check whether the decay rates are smaller than the minium energy splitting in the system Hamiltonian -> approximations for the validity of Lindblad Master equation (https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html)
